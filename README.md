# machine-learning-perceptron
Basic implementation of a backpropagation algorithm
Uses provided data set (data.csv) to make predictions of future peak mean dischage.
Implementation using both tanh and sigmoid transer functions.
Allows for momentumn, bold driver, changes in epochs and learning rate.
See report for full details of result.
